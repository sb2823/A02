# Glossary

**BRANCH**<br>

Git branches provide separate paths for project changes, allowing independent work on features or fixes without affecting the main version, facilitating organization and collaboration.

**CLONE** <br>

Cloning in Git allows developers to make local copies of repositories, which fosters collaboration and facilitates contributions to projects hosted on sites such as GitHub.

**COMMIT**<br>

In GitHub, committing is like taking pictures of your work, saving changes you've made to your project files with short messages. It helps you keep track of your progress and work with others on the same project.

**FETCH**<br>

Fetching is like looking for updates. It helps you get the latest changes from GitHub to your computer without mixing them with your work right away. This way, you can decide later whether to add those changes to your work or keep them separate.

**GIT**<br>

Git is like a working together platform for creating code, logging changes, allowing free-of-mistakes cooperation, operating as a time machine to return to previous versions, and keeping projects organized despite multiple members.

**GITHUB**<br>

GitHub is a platform for storing, sharing, and collaborating on code, akin to a social network for programmers, facilitating global teamwork and version control for software projects.

**MERGE**<br>

In GitHub, merging combines changes from one branch into another, facilitating integration of new features or fixes while preserving project history and collaboration among team members. It streamlines development workflows, ensuring smooth coordination and codebase continuity within the repository.

**MERGE Conflict**<br>

A merge conflict in GitHub occurs when conflicting changes exist between the branches being merged, requiring developers to resolve discrepancies manually by choosing which changes to retain, ensuring the smooth integration of code modifications and maintaining project coherence.

**PUSH**<br>

Pushing on GitHub means putting your local changes on the internet so others can see and work with them, like sharing your work with your team or anyone else. It updates the project's history on GitHub, allowing for collaboration and keeping track of changes.

**PULL**<br>

Pulling from GitHub transfers recent updates from the cloud to your local system, aligning your copy with the most recent project version, allowing collaboration and assuring code synchronization.

**REMOTE**<br>

A remote in GitHub acts as a link to your project's copy on the server, allowing for collaboration, version control, and synchronization between your local computer and the GitHub repository, like having a cloud backup accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.

**REPOSITORY**<br>

A repository serves as a central storage location for project files, making it easier to organize and retrieve papers, resources, and code-related information. It supports version control, contributor participation, effective project management, and a digital workspace for developers to track changes and organize development efforts.
