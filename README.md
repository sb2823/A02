# Clone
Cloning is a fundamental operation in Git and is often the first step when you want to start working on a project collaboratively or contribute to an existing project hosted on platforms like GitHub. It allows developers to have their own local copy of a repository, which they can modify, experiment with, and contribute changes back to the main project.
# commit
Commit in GitHub is like taking a snapshot of your work. It's a way to save changes you've made to your files in a project. Each commit has a brief message explaining what was changed or added. Commits help you keep track of your progress and collaborate with others on the same project.
